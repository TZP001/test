"To build an archive file based on the differences between the V5Rn GA and V5Rn SP2 levels, for example, run the CATDeltaInstall command as follows:
CATDeltaInstall -s 0 -d \"C:\ Program Files\Dassault Systemes\B0n\intel_a\" -a E:\users\MyUser\MyArchiveFile
 
 The full command syntax is: 
CATDeltaInstall -s PreviousServicePackNumber [-d InstallationDirectory] 
[-l|-a ArchiveFile] [-h]

-s: previous level number: the level can be either a service pack or the GA level for the same release; 
0 = GA, 1 = service pack 1, 2 = service pack 2, etc.; the default is 0.
A service pack must have been correctly installed if you intend to build an archive based on the differences between this service pack and another level. For example, if you installed only the V5Rn GA and V5Rn SP2 levels, you cannot specify \"-s 1\" as an argument (because you did not install the V5Rn SP1 level). 
-d: Installation directory; when the command is run from the installation directory, this argument is not required 
-l: only lists the files which are different between the two installation levels; this list can be used to build a different type of archive (for example, WinZip) 
-a: builds an archive file with the specified name (requires the CabArc utility) 
-h: help. 
Note that there are two distinct operating modes:

build an archive file (using the \"-a\" argument) 
only list the files which are different between the two installation levels (using the \"-l\" argument)";
