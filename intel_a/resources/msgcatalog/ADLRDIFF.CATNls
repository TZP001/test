(2) This command compares the two outlists and it generates the differences files only_in_ref, only_in_cur and diff_files.

Else, if the directories dir1 and dir2 are defined
   The files common to both outlists are compared into the directory dir1 and the directory dir2.
The outlists may be generated into different workspaces by different versions: the path and the object type are used instead of the identifier.
