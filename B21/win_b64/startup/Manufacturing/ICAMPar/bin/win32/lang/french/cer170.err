!   CAM-POST Version 16.0: Error Specification File

!
!	This file is a text oriented file which can be modified with an editor.
!	It contains all error messages recognized by the Controller Emulator.
!	Modifications to this file are allowed. To make the modifications known
!	to the Controller Emulator, the following steps are necessary.
!
!	1. Copy the original text file to a safe place and rename it if you like.
!	2. Modify the errors inside that new text file as you wish.
!	3. Set "erfile" in your default file to that new modified error text file.
!
!	Within this file any line starting with an "!" is a comment. Lines
!	starting with a "\" define an error message. Error message definitions
!	can be continued from one line to the next. Extra spacing characters
!	will be ignored. An error message consists of three fields, separated
!	by blanks or tabs:
!
!	1. Error number
!	2. Severity
!	3. Message
!
!	The error number field should not be modified as only these listed
!	numbers are known to the Controller Emulator. The severity field specifies
!	the severity of the error message. A negative severity disables the output
!	of that particular error message. The message field provides the text 
!	associated with the error. There is no length limitation on the message length.
!
!
! Error messages that must be the same number as the POS ones since they are used
! by shared source files between POS and CE
!
