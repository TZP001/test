      <br>
      We at ICAM Technologies Corporation would like to take this opportunity to thank you for
      taking the time to view our post-processing product. With the permission of CATIA, we

      including: NURBS Fitting, High Speed Machining, Linearization Rotary Turnaround and Path
      Planning, Tool-tip Programming (RTCP, TRAORI), Coordinate Frame Transformation and The
      Wizard.<br>
