<h2>Running a Sample</h2>

    <td>Each of these sample programs loads an ICAM PPTable, which defines the post-processor
      vocabulary that CATIA will output for standard operations. It is important to remember
      that an ICAM PPTable should always be loaded whenever using CAM-POST. You can do so by
      following these steps:
      <ol>
        <li>Select the <strong>Part Operation</strong> object in the CATIA navigation list.</li>
        <li>Select the <strong>Edit</strong> menu, <strong>Part Operation</strong> submenu, <strong>Definition</strong>
          object.</li>
        <li>Select the icon of the NC machine on the window that appears.</li>

      the batch mode of operation, be sure to save your CATProcess first, since the batch mode
      processor uses the copy of the CATProcess last saved on disk, and not the one you are
      editing! You do not need to save your CATProcess when using the interactive mode of
      operation.
      <p>When the dialog window appears, select the<strong> In/Out</strong> tab to specify the
      manufacturing operations to post-process as well as the output format and file name.</p>
      <p>A manufacturing program must be selected. Normally one is selected by default, unless
      manufacturing steps have not yet been defined.</p>
      <p>The resulting NC data must be set to <strong>NC Code</strong>. The Output File must be
      specified with a complete path, which you can best do by selecting the <strong>Output&nbsp;File</strong>
      button instead of typing the file name directly into the field.<br>

      <p>A number of demonstration and/or production post-processors should be listed in the

      used to select alternate aptsource files, post-processors (and post-processor databases),
      as well as to select different program options and run-time display modes. This same

<h2><a name="CatiaSetup">CATIA Setup</a> for Licensed CAM-POST Users</h2>

    <td>CATIA ships with a CAM-POST GENER executable, designed to run demonstration
      post-processors. Licensed CAM-POST users should run the <b>kit/CATIA/setup.exe</b>
      program, which is copied below the installation point when CAM-POST is installed. This
      setup program can be used to tell CATIA to run the version of CAM-POST received and
      installed from ICAM, instead of the default one that comes with the CATIA installation.
      Windows<small><sup>TM</sup></small> users can find a link to the setup program in the
      Start/Programs/CAM-POST quick-start folder. A sample Windows<small><sup>TM</sup></small>
      output follows:
      <p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/setup.gif" width="389" height="314"></p>
      <p>Those users with Administrator privileges can set the default for all users of the
      computer. Select one of the &quot;<b>Use this version</b>&quot; check-boxes to have CATIA
      use the licensed CAM-POST version of GENER instead of the CATIA default.</p>
      <p>Starting with CATIA V5 R12 SP4, it is possible to have a list of generated and
      dedicated post processors from a CAM-POST database appear in CATIA post-processor
      drop-down menus (in the <i>Generate NC Code/NC Code</i> dialog and also the <i>Part
      Operation/Machine Editor</i> dialog). This is done using the &quot;<b>Database</b>&quot;
      selections in the setup program. The default CAM-POST database or a selected CAM-POST
      database can be chosen.</p>
      <p>If desired, the CATIA post-processor drop-downs can continue to show ICAM
      demonstration post processors. This is done by selecting the &quot;<b>Also include...</b>&quot;
      check-box. Note that demonstration post-processors with output limits will continue to
      enforce these limits, despite the presence of a CAM-POST license. To remove this
      limitation, the demonstration post-processor must be imported into a CAM-POST database.
      Demonstration post-processors can be found in the <b>Startup/Manufacturing/ICAMPar/work</b>
      directory below the CATIA installation point.</p>
