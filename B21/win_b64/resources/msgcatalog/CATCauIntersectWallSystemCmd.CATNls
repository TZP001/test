"The wrapping surface selected has only one published surface.  This implies the intersection may form a closed loop.  In this
case, attempting to extract wall system geometry or related compartments may yield ambiguous situations and the operation
could fail.  It is strongly recommended that you divide the wrapping surface into multiple published surfaces.  

Hit OK to intersect, Cancel to cancel the intersection.";
