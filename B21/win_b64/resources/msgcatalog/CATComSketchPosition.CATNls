UseEdge1.Message = "The sketch contains external references (projection, intersection).\n
If you modify its position, this sketch may become inconsistent or over-constrained.";
Cycle.Message = "You cannot select this element. It would create an update cycle.";
LineSupportError.Message = "Impossible to position the sketch support: the two reference lines are parallel or non-coplanar.\n
You need to select non-parallel and coplanar lines.";
IntersectionOriginError.Message = "Impossible to define the origin: intersection with the sketch plane failed.\nIntersection does not exist or many intersections exist.";
LineOriginError.Message = "Impossible to define the origin: the two reference lines are parallel or non-coplanar.\n
You need to select non-parallel and coplanar lines.";
OrientError.Message = "Impossible to define the orientation: the computation of the normal definition has failed.\n
Either there is no solution or several solutions.";
OrientDirectionError.Message = "Impossible to define the orientation: the entered values are invalid.\n
You need to enter valid values.";
