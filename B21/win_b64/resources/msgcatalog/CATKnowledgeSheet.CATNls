"    - Synchronization Options:\n    The synchronization notion is only for cases where design table file data has been copied into the model.\n",
"    The automatic synchronization means that the the content of the table is always the same than the content of the file.\n",
"    The interactive synchronization is going to raise a panel after the load that will allow you to decide if synchronization has to be done or not.\n",
"    The manual synchronization implies that no synchronization is done until you synchronize with Edit Links or with Contextual Menu on design table\n",
"    - Copy Data Options:\n    This option controls the activation of Copy Data Into Model mode for new design tables";

"    - The Synchronous mode enables you to create synchronous relations, that is to say relations that will be immediately updated if one of their parameters is modified. \n",
"      Relations based on parameters are the only ones that can be synchronous.\n",
"    - Enables you to associate the evaluation of asynchronous relations with the global update.";
