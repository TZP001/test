3D contact
Compensation is computed along a 3D vector (XN, YN, ZN), normal to the part surface, in contact with the end of the tool. 
The radius that is compensated is the corner radius.
Output is the contact point (XC, YC, ZC) and the part surface normal (XN, YN, ZN). 
The tool tip point (XT, YT, ZT) may also be given if this choice is set on the machine. 
Tool axis vector (IJK) is output in multi-axis.";
