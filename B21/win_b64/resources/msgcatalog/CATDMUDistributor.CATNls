                   For file based document, the identifier is the path of the
                   document (containing eventually a DLName preceeded by 'CATDLN://').
                   For VPM based document, the identifier is 'COID COMPID CAENV CATAB'.
   cachedir      : To define the distant cache directory.
   docdir        : To define the distance directory that will contains all
                   documents except cache data.
                   This directory can be a DLName preceeded by 'CATDLN://'.
   -list file    : Output file that will contains a list of documents to copy.
                   Each line contains the path of original data and the path of
                   the copy data separated by a blank.
