Specifies how the image is positioned on the page as well as the image size.
'No fitting' prints the image on a 1:1 scale.
'Fit in page' centers the image and selects the appropriate scale to make
the image as big as possible inside the margins.
'Scale' sets the scale (in percent) of the image with respect to the document, 
or sets the image dimensions to the selected format.
'Left' and 'Bottom' set the distance from the left and bottom margins, respectively.
'Width' and 'Height' set the image dimensions. 'Width' and 'Height' are linked so
that the Width/Height ratio remains constant. Changing Scale, Width or Height
refreshes these three parameters simultaneously.";
